# Can-I-Bike

## Description

* As a biker, I want to know the weather and the amount of rentable bikes in an area I am traveling to, as well as where the bikes can be picked up.
* When I search a city name, I am given the weather in the city and companies that rent bikes in the area
* When I look for more information about the companies that rent bikes, I am given the stations in the city where bikes are rented and more information about them
